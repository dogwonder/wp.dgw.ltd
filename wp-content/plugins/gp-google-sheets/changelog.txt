# Changelog

## 1.1.17 | May 22, 2024

- Added support for GP Populate Anything 2.1's new React-based field settings.
- Fixed issue where the field map cache would not be properly flushed when adding/deleting columns in feed settings.

## 1.1.16 | May 8, 2024

- Fixed issue where HTTP timeouts would not be respected in requests to the Google Sheets API.

## 1.1.15 | May 1, 2024

- Added a feed conditional logic check before processing entry edit events (if "Edit rows when entries are edited" is enabled). This addresses an issue where entries could get added to sheets during delayed payment flows.

## 1.1.14

- Fixed issue where fetching spreadsheet/sheet information in the WordPress Admin could trigger an out-of-memory error for complex spreadsheets.

## 1.1.13

- Fixed a PHP deprecation notice caused by an optional parameter being declared before a required parameter.
- Fixed a PHP deprecation notice that occurs upon activating the plugin without a previous version installed.

## 1.1.12

- Fixed an issue where the cache is not purged when an account is disconnected.
- Fixed List field value formatting when sending to Google Sheets.

## 1.1.11

- Updated `gpgs_row_value` to fire for custom values as well.

## 1.1.10

- Updated the "Row Number" property in the Populate Anything Object Type to not support filtering as it is a hashed value and sorting will not produce an expectable result. Additionally, it has been renamed to "Row Hash" in the user interface. The main reason for keeping this property was to maintain backwards compatibility and to have a unique property to use when leveraging Field Value Objects.

## 1.1.9

- Added support for reordering GP Google Sheets feeds.

- Removed unnecessary `gf_apply_filters( array( 'gform_form_export_page', $form_id ) )` call when inserting rows into a sheet.
- Fixed an issue where manually processing Google Sheets feeds then navigating to other entries using the arrows buttons could lead to other entries getting reprocessed.

## 1.1.7

- Fixed errors that could occur due to either malformed token arrays or missing plugin settings for legacy tokens.
- Fixed error that could occur with the Populate Anything Object Type if there are no available Google Accounts.

## 1.1.6
